<h1>-cp-102 Setup Guide-</h1>

<p>
Welcome on the Setup guide of cp-102. 
In order to setup the c&c of this software you need to
follow the steps below.
</p><br>
<h2>-Pre-Deployment</h2><p>First of all you need a web server.
I suggest you to download <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/it/download.html">XAMPP 5</a> for Windows or using pre installed
Apache on Linux. I this paper we 'll see the installation under
Windows 10, but the installation under Linux is pretty similar.

This software has been developed under PHP5 so using it under higher 
version it could cause troubles.
</p><br>
<h2>-Deployment</h2><p>
Once Xampp has been installed browse in its folder that should
be located under '<i>c:\Xampp\htdocs\</i>' and create a new
directory, you can name it as you want but i suggest you
'<i>cp-102</i>'. Now drag and drop there all files you downloaded.

Now running XAMPP you need to start : <b>Apache</b> and <b>MySQL</b> services
from the main menu. You should see that the status near the names has turned
out green, this means they're running.

Open a web browser, the top should be Firefox. And surf to the following address
or just click on it <a href="http://127.0.0.1/cp-102/setup.php">http://127.0.0.1/cp-102/setup.php</a>.
Remember that if you named the installation folder in another way just replace
the name in the link '<i>cp-102</i>' with your directory name.

And you should see an installation page that asks for different things.
</p><br>
<h2>-Installation</h2><p>
Under '<i>MySQL Server</i>' tab you need to insert the credentials to access
to the MySQL service but usually they're : <br><br>
* Host : 127.0.0.1
* User : root
* Pass : <i>empty</i>
<br><br>
Now in the Database input you can enter whatever name you want but as always
I suggest you to enter : '<i>cp102</i>'.

After that you have to choose a username and a strong password for the C&C root user,
this is your free choice.

Once done everything make sure that is all correct and click '<i>Install</i>'.
If everything goes fine you should see a dialog above that shows every step in <font color="green">green</font>.
If not just check the error and try to fix it but if you did follow this
paper correctly you should be good.

Perfect! Now the C&C is ready on: <a href="http://127.0.0.1/cp-102/login.php">http://127.0.0.1/cp-102/login.php</a> And
as always replace the folder name if you changed it to point to the correct page.

Just insert the credentials you have inserted previuosly and there you go.
</p><br>
<h2>-Builder</h2><p>
In the installation folder of cp-102 there's a sub folder name <i>Builder</i>
and inside there's an .EXE file. Open in and here you have to insert your
gate location:
* Panel URL: your hostname for the c&c, for example <i>http://127.0.0.1</i>
* Path to gate file : the folder where you placed the gate.php file that must be 
int the main installation directory.
*Request Interval : it's the delay between each update request, do not select more
than 10 seconds or the client will go offline each 10 seconds on the web client.
*Tag : this is just a note to identify your bot, remember change it on every build.
*Mutex : this is to avoid multiple stub instances on the same machine.

*Registry Key Name : Startup key name, use something simple such as <i>svchost</i> or <i>explorer</i>.
*Startup : this add the client to the startup folder.
*Change Icon : check the checkbox and select a icon file for your stub.
*Bsod : this is process protection, the stub process gets flagged by protected by 
administrator, the user must kill the process only via admin cmd.
*Hide Process : this is a rootkit like feature but works only on 32 bit systems.

Once you done everything just click <b>Build</b> in the <i>Compile</i> tab
and save your malware.

In the end if you run that you'll se it in you C&C bot list page and from there
you can administrate your botnet as you want, using the built in features:

*Download & Execute
*Visit WebPages (Hidden or not)
*Session Management

I leave you telling that you can share your access with whoever you want
under the <i>Users</i> tab you can create new users with different permissions
in order to administrate even your friends actions.
