HTTP Botnet 

Here's a simple HTTP botnet, server side written in PHP, client side written in VB.net.
Here are some simple features :


- Download & Execute
- Visit website hidden or visibile
- Session control

The client sources will be release in future if this botnet will be used.


For the installation just check the folder 'doc' and you'll find the instructions.

# Only for study
Of course these sources are only for study and to demostrate how the protocol HTTP can be used to create a cluster of remote controlled machines. We don't take any kind of responsability by the use of other users in any way.

You wrong, your troubles.

Feel free to modify or implementing it, and as we said if it'll we used we'll release the client sources.
Please report bugs or errors and we'll try to fix them.

Enjoy.
